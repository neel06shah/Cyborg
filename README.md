**Tally On Lan**

Started as a fun project and ended here

With this application you can connect to your tally on a local network

You can view reports like StockSumary,DayBook,Profit&Loss,BalanceSheet,LedgerVoucher etc..

All you need is IP Address of the Machine where tally is running and ODBC Port of tally

You need to enable tally to act as an odbc server and set the port to 9000 which is default

You can enable by going to GatewayOfTally->F12 Configuration->Advanced Configuration->Set tallyerp9 acting as 'Server' and enable ODBC Server to 'Yes' then set Port to '9000' which is default

Make your Machine ip address static (where tally is installed) so you need to enter everytime

While using the application make sure tally is running and company is opened

Browse through the source tree, if you are interested to see how it works

Its free software and free to use,go ahead and clone/download, make changes and do a Pull request 

Always welcome to add/request new features and be a part of the project
